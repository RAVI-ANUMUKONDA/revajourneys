To,

The Visa Officer,
Embassy of Austria, 
New Delhi, India.

I am Mrs. Silpa Boyapati bearing Indian passport no: AM779455. I am planning to visit Austria and Czech Republic for a short vacation to spend some quality time and also would like to explore Tourist and Historical attractions in and around Austria and Czech Republic. My travel dates are 21.04.2026 to 02.05.2026.

I am a housewife and all my expenses will be taken care by my husband Mr. Srinivasa Sri Krishna Boyapati (U1747058). During my visit to Austria, I would be staying at below mentioned hotel.

Hotel George Vienna, Sechshauser Straße 83, 1150 Wien, Vienna, Austria.

During my visit to Austria and Czech Republic, all expenses towards my trip will be taken care by my husband Mr. Srinivasa Sri Krishna Boyapati since he has sufficient funds in his bank account to meet my expenses while I am in the Austria and Czech Republic. Documents like his Bank statement & IT Returns and Firm Documents were enclosed along with my visa application for your perusal. I will make sure that I will return to my home country at the end of our stay since I have to take care of my family members in India. I request your kind office to issue necessary visa to facilitate my travel to Austria and Czech Republic.

Note: I am planning for more visits to Austria and other Schengen countries in future, hence I request your kind office to help me with atleast 4-5yrs multiple entry visa for my future travels.

SILPA BOYAPATI
